            <h4>CruiseControl</h4>
            <p>
                In software development, CruiseControl is a Java-based framework for a continuous build process. It includes, but is not limited to, plugins for email notification, Ant, and various source control tools. A web interface is provided to view the details of the current and previous builds. It allows one to perform a continuous integration of any software development process.
            </p><p>
                CruiseControl is free, open-source software, distributed under a BSD-style license. It was originally created by employees of ThoughtWorks to allow for continuous integration on a project they were working on. It was later extracted into a stand-alone application.
            </p><p>
                There is a version of CruiseControl for .NET called CruiseControl.NET (aka CCNet) and a version for Ruby called CruiseControl.rb.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong> CruiseControl is composed of 3 main modules:</strong>
            </p>
            <ul style="margin-left:20px;">
                <li>
                    The build loop: core of the system, it triggers build cycles then notifies various listeners (users) using various publishing techniques. The trigger can be internal (scheduled or upon changes in a SCM) or external. It is configured in a xml file which maps the build cycles to certain tasks, thanks to a system of plugins. Depending on configuration, it may produce build artifacts.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The jsp reporting application allows the users to browse the results of the builds and access the artifacts
                </li>
                <li>
                    The dashboard provides a visual representation of all project build statuses.
                </li>
            </ul>

        <div id="Advantages" class="tab-pane fade">
            <h4>Advantages</h4>

            <strong> Continuous integration has many advantages:</strong>

            <p>
                •  When unit tests fail or a bug emerges, developers might revert the codebase back to a bug-free state, without wasting time debugging
            </p><p>
                •  Developers detect and fix integration problems continuously - avoiding last-minute chaos at release dates, (when everyone tries to check in their slightly incompatible versions).
            </p><p>
                •  Early warning of broken/incompatible code
            </p><p>
                •  Early warning of conflicting changes
            </p><p>
                •  Immediate unit testing of all changes
            </p><p>
                •  Constant availability of a "current" build for testing, demo, or release purposes
            </p><p>
                •  Immediate feedback to developers on the quality, functionality, or system-wide impact of code they are writing
            </p>

            <h4>Disadvantages</h4>
            <p>
                •  Initial setup time required
            </p><p>
                •  Well-developed test-suite required to achieve automated testing advantages
            </p><p>
                •  Large-scale refactoring can be troublesome due to continuously changing code base
            </p><p>
                •  Hardware costs for build machines can be significant
            </p>
