            <h4>UrbanCode Release</h4>
            <p>
                IBM UrbanCode Release, formerly called uRelease, is a collaborative release management tool that helps you handle the growing number and complexity of releases. You can plan, execute, and track a release through every stage of the delivery lifecycle. Based on lessons learned from working with our customers, UrbanCode Release reduces errors, while making large releases faster and more agile.

            <h4>System requirements</h4>
            <p>
                The IBM® UrbanCode™ Release server requires a 64-bit operating system and JRE. If you plan to install the server in a production environment, a supporting database is required. If you do not plan to install the server in a production environment, you can use the Apache Derby database, which is bundled with the product.
            </p><p>
                You must have a Rational® Common Licensing server with available licenses. The server must be able to initiate connections to the license server. The default port for Rational Common Licensing is 27000. The server might require access to other ports if you connect to external systems, such as an SMTP server for notifications.
            </p><p>
                For best performance, follow these guidelines:
            </p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
                <li>
                    When possible, install the server as a dedicated user account. However, IBM UrbanCode Release runs well as a root user (or local system user on Windows), and running this way is the easiest method to avoid permission errors.
                </li>
                <li>
                    For best server performance, install the server on a system that is dedicated to the server and does not run any other major software.
                </li>
                <li>
                    For best performance, set the Java heap size to at least 2GB, -Xmx2G.
                </li>
                <li>
                    For servers on Linux or UNIX, increase the process and file limit for the server. Add the following lines to the /etc/security/limits.conf file and then restarting the server computer:
                </li>

                            If you are installing the server in a production environment, a supporting database is required. Whether you install a database or use an existing installation of a database, you need the connection information for the database when you install the IBM UrbanCode Release server.

                            If you are installing on a Windows Server 2008 or Windows Server 2012, install IBM UrbanCode Release as a service to avoid problems with permissions. If you do not install as a IBM UrbanCode Release service or you start the Tomcat server using the command line, you must disable Windows User Account Control (UAC) manually.

            <h4>What's New in UrbanCode Release 6.2.1.3</h4>
            <h5>Service level agreement tasks (beta feature)</h5>
            <p>
                You can use three new task types to manage service level agreements (SLA), such as time-critical events, and planned outages.
            </p><h5> Outage tasks</h5>
            <p>

                Use outage tasks to manage systems that can only be down for a specified time period. When you create an outage, a begin task and an end task are inserted into the deployment plan. You can add related tasks between the begin and end tasks, and you are alerted if the total duration exceeds the planned-for time. In the following figure, you can see that the outage of 1 hour is exceeded by 5 minutes due to the duration of the related tasks.
            </p><h5>
                Critical event tasks
            </h5>
            <p>

                Use critical event tasks to manage service level agreements that require events to occur at specified times. If tasks are expected to be late, an alert suggests an earlier start time. In the following figure, the server must be back online by 11:30 but the deployment is running behind schedule.
            </p><h5>
                Wait-for-time tasks
            </h5>
            <p>
                Wait-for-time tasks do not complete until a specified time. You can use wait-for-time tasks as buffers to control the deployment pace.
            </p><h5>
                SLA reports
            </h5>
            <p>
                The scheduled deployment’s Overview tab now lists all outages and critical events, and alerts you when they are running ahead or behind schedule, as shown in the following figure. The Overview tab displays progress bars for tasks that fall within an outage or that are on the path of critical events. You can export reports that compare actual to planned service level agreements.
            </p><h5>
                SLA notifications
            </h5>
            <p>
                There are four new notification rules for service level agreement tasks that let you know when SLA-related events happen in your scheduled deployments. You can configure notifications to be sent when outages or critical events finish late or if they are estimated to be more than x minutes late.
            </p><h5>
                Banner messages
            </h5>
            <p>
                Messages can be displayed in page headers that notify users about important events. Links can be included in the messages. Banner messages are managed on the System Settings page.
            </p><h5>
                User dashboard
            </h5>
            <p>
                The user dashboard is your IBM UrbanCode Release home page. The dashboard home page displays information that is customized for you. From the dashboard, you can access your applications and tasks, schedule deployments, and provide approvals.
