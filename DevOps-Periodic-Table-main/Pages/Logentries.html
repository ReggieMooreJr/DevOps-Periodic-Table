            <h4>Logentries</h4>
            <p>
                Logentries is a leading SaaS-delivered log management and real-time analytics service, making business insights from machine-generated log data simply accessible to development, IT and business operations teams of all sizes. While traditional log management tools require advanced technical skills to use, and are costly to set-up, Logentries provides a simply accessible alternative for managing huge amounts of data, visualizing insights that matter, and sharing that information across its global user community.
            </p><p>
                The Logentries real-time user monitoring capability uses client side libraries (supporting iOS, Android, HTML5, JavaScript and Windows Mobile) to gather event data from a user's browser or client device, and sends it directly to the Logentries service. Unlike traditional web analytics tools that only show high level aggregate views of visitor activity, Logentries enables customers to track events at the individual user level, capturing specific event activity in real-time. Logentries also allows customers to include custom payload information in order to capture performance and business-related information on specified user events. With this breadth of log data captured, for example, customers can associate the context of logged user events with relevant metrics such as response time or the monetary value of a given user action.
            </p><p>
                "Tracking our customers' actions is extremely important to improving Codeship's continuous deployment technology, "said Moritz Plassnig, CEO, Codeship. "Now that Logentries supports user tracking with log data and analysis, we can get insight into every user action, follow high-priority accounts and see trends across groups of users in real-time."
            </p><p>
                "This is an exciting technology that enables our customers to understand their users' experience and behavior, in real-time as the events occur on their websites, and in their web applications," said Dr. Trevor Parsons, Logentries Co-founder and Chief Scientist. "It is a great example of using logs as data and is more flexible and scalable than traditional web analytics tools. We set this up internally in minutes and are now using it to understand which features customers are using and if individual users are experiencing any performance issues."
            </p><p>
                Logentries is featuring the auto-log capability in its internal sign-up process for all new users. Once a new user has started a free account, an auto-log is immediately created and begins capturing an audit trail of the user's own activity.
            </p><p>
                Logentries is offering a quick-start technical session with a designated technical specialist to discuss best practices and technical audits for real-time user monitoring using log data.

                    <h5> Agent Based Logging</h5><p>
                        Logentries provides agents that will help simplify and automate log collection in your environment. These agents are compatible with the following operating systems: Linux (and many of its distros), Windows and Mac. The lightweight agents combine ease of use with powerful command line capabilities
                    </p>
                    <h5>Syslog Forwarding</h5><p>
                        Use your operating systems’ log forwarder to send logs from your operating system directly to your Logentries account. The following docs pages will help you configure forwarding for Linux based (Rsyslog, Syslog-D, Syslog-NG) operating systems
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you are using Rsyslog in a large or autoscaling environment we have created this guide
                    </p>
                    <h5> Docker Logging Container</h5>
                    <p>
                        Our Logging Container built for Docker features easy collection and analysis of container-level performance stats and system-level log data. The new Logentries Container features Docker’s new stats API and addresses existing challenges with logging on Docker, enabling easy access to collecting and visualising important server and resources usage stats.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Application Logging</h5>
                    <p>
                        Logentries supports in-application logging from a wide variety of programming languages such as Python, PHP, Java, iOS, Android, JavaScript, HTML5, NodeJS, .NET and many others.
                    </p><h5>Token Based Logging</h5>
                    <p>
                        Token-based logging will allow you to easily route data from multiple instances of an application into a single container in the Logentries UI. This method can be used with various integration strategies called out above such as syslog or our API forwarders. This is the recommended method for autoscaling environments, large environments or from sources where the public IP address will change.

                    Navigating Your Account<br />
                    <p>
                        This section will introduce you to some of the key terminology and navigation techniques that will allow you to easily find important events in your account.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Key Terminology </h5>
                    <p>
                        During the setup process you organised your log events into Log Sets and Logs in the Logentries UI. Now we will cover some of the basics for effectively navigating your account and managing your Log Sets. Beyond the essentials of navigation we will cover three other important topics.
                    </p>
                    <ul style="margin-left:20px">
                        <li>
                            Log Sets – Are the top level of the hierarchy, they provide structure and contain one or more Logs. They can represent a wide variety of groupings from Individual hosts to Autoscaling groups.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Logs – Contain the log entries which you will be viewing, searching and analysing
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Log Shortcuts – Provide a mechanism to view an aggregate set of logs with a single click
                            <br />
                            Your account will always have the default Log Shortcuts for “All” and “None”, later in this document you will see how to configure custom shortcuts.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <div style="margin-left:30px">
                        <img src="/static/images/le4.png" style="width:35%" />
                    </div>
                    <h5>Essentials of Navigation </h5>
                    <p>When Logging in you’ll be presented with the top level list of log sets. You can quickly navigate to the list of logs by clicking the icon next to the Log Set in the Log Selector (left pane) or by clicking the Log Set name in the main workspace</p>
                    <div style="margin-left:30px">
                        <img src="/static/images/le5.png" style="width:85%" />
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        You can view the logs events contained within a log event in a few different ways. If you follows the step above to view the list of logs you can click the log name in the main workspace. You can also use the log selector checkboxes to view multiple logs at one time. Clicking the log set checkbox will display the aggregated events of all underlying logs.
                    </p>
                    <div style="margin-left:30px">
                        <img src="/static/images/le6.png" style="width:85%" />
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        If I want to quickly find Log Sets or Logs in the Log Selector I can use the search bar at the bottom. I can filter to a specific Log Set and quickly select all of the logs from that log set.
                    </p>
                    <div style="margin-left:30px">
                        <img src="/static/images/le7.png" style="width:35%" />
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        I could also filter by the Log name, this would allow me for instance to easily view my all of my access logs from my web server. Anytime I want to navigate back to the main list of Log Sets I can click Log Sets above the Log Selector or in the breadcrumb.
                    </p>
                    <div style="margin-left:30px">
                        <img src="/static/images/le8.png" style="width:85%" />
                    </div>
                    <h5>  Log Shortcuts</h5>
                    <p>
                        A Log Shortcut is a predefined aggregate view of the Logs in your account. This allows the user to access the specified logs in a single click. Using Log Shortcuts will greatly increase the efficiency for users who often view and analyze log data against a similar set of logs.
                    </p><h5>Create a Log Shortcut</h5>
                    <p>
                        Click the Add new button located above the Log Sets
                    </p>
                    <div style="margin-left:30px">
                        <img src="/static/images/le9.png" style="width:45%" />
                    </div>
                    <ul style="margin-left:25px">
                        <li>
                            Shortcut Name: Name that will be displayed in the list of log shortcuts.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Which logs should be included: The first text field allows you to filter the log sets and logs displayed to ensure easy log shortcut management in large environments. The lower field allows you to select all of the logs that you want included in the log shortcut. Logs included in the log shortcut will always be visible in this space.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Live Tail and Viewing Logs.
                    <p>In the previous section we reviewed the basics of navigation and important terminology. This section covers the various options for viewing your log events. When viewing log events of interest, all options can be found in the top right corner of the screen.</p>
                    <div style="margin-left:30px">
                        <img src="/static/images/le10.png" style="width:65%" />
                    </div>
                    <h5> Live Tail</h5>
                    <p>
                        Live tail will allow you to view your live log data as it streams into your account. This is very useful for testing during development and troubleshooting operational issues. The live tail consists of three buttons:
                    </p>
                    <h5>Enter Live Tail</h5>
                    <div style="margin-left:30px">
                        <img src="/static/images/le11.png" style="width:20%" />
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Clicking the live tail button will allow you to view the events as they stream into your account. The most recent events will appear at the bottom of the screen
                    </p>
                    <h5> Pause Live Tail</h5>
                    <div style="margin-left:30px">
                        <img src="/static/images/le12.png" style="width:20%" />
                    </div>
                    <p>Clicking the pause button will freeze the current view allowing you view a snapshot of the log events at that moment in time</p>
                    <h5>Exit Live Tail </h5>
                    <div style="margin-left:30px">
                        <img src="/static/images/le13.png" style="width:20%" />
                    </div>
                    <p>Clicking the exit live tail button will return you to the standard view of your log data</p>
                    <h5>Viewing Options </h5>
                    <p>There are a variety of options that will make viewing your log events easier:</p>
                    <div style="margin-left:30px">
                        <img src="/static/images/le14.png" style="width:35%" />
                    </div>
                    <h5>Display Timestamp</h5>
                    <p>
                        Quickly toggle whether to display the Logentries timestamp at the start of your logs. These will be localised to your timezone based on the settings in your account eliminating the need to correlate regional timezone of geographically dispersed infrastructure.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Expand JSON</h5>
                    <p>JSON structured logs can be prettified to easily view the event hierarchy.</p>
                    <h5>Wrap Text</h5>
                    <p>
                        By default long log events will trail off the right side of the screen, enabling this option will cause them to wrap and continue on the next line.
                    </p>
                    <div style="margin-left:30px">
                        <img src="/static/images/le15.png" style="width:45%" />
                    </div>
                    <p>For a detailed overview of navigating and managing logs and log sets please see the [detailed documentation found here]. This will cover how to rename and delete log sets</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Search Your Logs
                    <p>
                        Logentries’ search capabilities are both powerful and flexible. You can search by simple keywords or use regular expressions directly in the search bar for advanced pattern matching. Logical operators and calculation functions are also available for adding logic, grouping data and calculating values.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Keyword AND KVP search </h5>
                    <p>Searching by keyword is just like searching with Google. Simply type what you want to see and click the Find button. Keyword search is particularly useful when searching for a specific key or value within a key-value pair. In the example below, searching the keyword “clicked” returns events containing the word “clicked”.</p>
                    <div style="margin-left:30px">
                        <a href="Images/le16.png" target="_blank" title="click to enlarge"><img src="/static/images/le16.png" style="width:100%" /></a>
                    </div>
                    <h5>Logical Operators </h5>
                    <p>Using logical operators, you can narrow your search to more specific results. AND, OR and NOT are available and should always be capitalised when used. In the example below, using the AND operator returns only results that include click events where id=log-list. For more information on using logical operators, review our dedicated logical operators documentation.</p>
                    <div style="margin-left:30px">
                        <a href="Images/le17.png" target="_blank" title="click to enlarge"><img src="/static/images/le17.png" style="width:100%" /></a>
                    </div>
                    <h5>RegEx Search </h5>
                    <p>
                        Logentries search supports regular expressions (RegEx) for advanced pattern matching. If you’re comfortable with RegEx, you can build powerful searches to find patterns in event data like IP addresses. For more information on RegEx, consider visiting regexr.com. In the example below, we use regular expressions to match a pattern of digits. For more information on how to use RegEx within Logentries, review our dedicated RegEx search documentation
                    </p>
                    <div style="margin-left:30px">
                        <a href="Images/le18.png" target="_blank" title="click to enlarge"><img src="/static/images/le18.png" style="width:100%" /></a>
                    </div>
                    <h5>Calculation Functions </h5>
                    <p>
                        Calculation functions enable users to group event types and calculate values for deeper analysis. Calculation functions include SUM, COUNT, COUNT UNIQUE, AVERAGE and GROUP BY.

                Disadvantages
            </h4>
            <ul style="margin-left:25px">
                <li>
                    No specialized reporting for JavaScript- No stack trace, or XHR recording. Compare with UserSnap or Rollbar or TrackJS.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Signing up requires phone number
                </li>
                <li>
                    No CDN for the web client logger
                </li>
                <li>
                    TypeErrors (X is not a function) are not tracked- LogEntries doesn't seem to catch them even if catchall is set to true. See the GitHub issue.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Character limit for each log entry - Currently log entries are limited to 8192 characters, if your log entry runs over this amount then it will be truncated where the excess log will be a new entry in the UI. This can easily cause a problem JSON structure with java stacktraces.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Expensive - The average plan is over $1.5 per GB, which can get very expensive for any sort of reasonable volume.
