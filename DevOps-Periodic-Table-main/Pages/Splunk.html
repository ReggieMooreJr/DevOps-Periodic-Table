            <h4>What is Splunk® Enterprise ?</h4>
            <p>
                Splunk is software that indexes IT data from any application, server or network device that makes up your IT infrastructure. It's a powerful and versatile search and analysis engine that lets you investigate, troubleshoot, monitor, alert, and report on everything that's happening in your entire IT infrastructure from one location in real time.
            </p><p>
                <strong>
                    Splunk Enterprise makes it simple to collect, analyze and act upon the untapped value of the big data generated by your technology infrastructure, security systems and business applications
                </strong>
            </p><p>
                Splunk produces software for searching, monitoring, and analyzing machine-generated big data, via a web-style interface. Their flagship offering is Splunk Enterprise, “a machine data engine with collection, indexing, search, reporting analysis, and data management capabilities that allows dynamic schema creation on the fly, enabling users to run queries on data without having to understand the structure of the data prior to collection and indexing
            </p><p>
                Splunk (the product) captures, indexes and correlates real-time data in a searchable repository from which it can generate graphs, reports, alerts, dashboards and visualizations.

            <h4>Why do we need to use Splunk ?</h4>
            <p>
                Machine data is complex to understand, in an unstructured format and not suitable for making analysis / visualization. This is where a tool like Splunk comes in handy. You can feed the machine data to Splunk, which will do the dirty work(data processing) for you. Once it processes and extracts the relevant data, you will be able to easily locate where and what the problems were.
            </p><p>
                Since Splunk can store and process large amounts of data, data analysts like myself started feeding big data to Splunk for analysis. Dashboards meant for visualization was a revelation and within no time Splunk was extensively used in the big data domain for analytics.
            </p>

            <strong>Search Best Practice</strong>
            <ul style="margin-left:25px">
                <li>
                    Always use index= &lt;yourindexname&gt; in the beginning of your searches. If index name is not used, query will take much longer to fetch the desired results.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Use Time Picker to limit search results is the most efficient way to search for events
                </li>
                <li>
                    The more you tell the search engine, the more likely it is that you will get good results. Include as many search criteria as possible (i.e. better to search on Failed Password than the word Failed)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Inclusion is generally better than exclusion (Access denied instead of searching NOT Access granted)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Apply filtering command as early as possible in your search
                </li>
                <li>
                    Do not create any searches, alerts, dashboards, reports, etc. (knowledge objects) in general Search App. They should only be created in your team App (custom Splunk App).

            <h5>Start Splunk on Windows</h5>
            <p>To start Splunk on Windows, you have three options:</p>
            <ul style="margin-left:25px">
                <li>
                    Start Splunk from • the Start menu.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Use the Windows Services Manager to start and stop splunkd and splunkweb.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Open a cmd window and go to \Program Files\Splunk\bin and type
                    <ul style="margin-left:25px">
                        <li>splunk start</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Launch Splunk Web</h5>
            <p>
                Splunk's interface runs as a Web server and after starting up, Splunk tells you
                where the Splunk Web interface is. Open a browser and navigate to that location.
                Splunk Web runs by default on port 8000 of the host on which it's installed. If you
                are using Splunk on your local machine, the URL to access Splunk Web is
                http://localhost:8000.
            </p><p>
                If you are using an Enterprise license, launching Splunk for the first time takes
                you to this login screen. Follow the message to authenticate with the default
                credentials:
            </p>

                    This takes you to the Add Data to Splunk dialogue where you can Choose a Data Type to add Or Choose a Data Source.

                This takes you to the Preview data dialogue, which enables you to see a
                preview of the data before you add it to a Splunk index. For the purposes of this
                tutorial, you won't need to do this. If you're interested in reading more about data
                preview, refer to "Overview of data preview" in the Getting Data In manual.

                This takes you to the Home > Add data > Files & directories > Add new view.
                This is where you will upload the sample data file. Normally, this is all you need
                to do and Splunk handles the rest without any changes needed. For the
                purposes of this tutorial, however, you will also edit some of the properties.

            </ul>
            <p>
                The source of an event tells you where it came from. If you collect data from files
                and directories, the "source" is the full pathname of the file or directory. In the
                case of a network-based source, the source is the protocol and port, such as
                UDP:514.

            </ul>

                This enables you to override Splunk's default settings for Host, Source type, and Index.
                An event's host value is typically the hostname, IP address, or fully qualified
                domain name of the network host from which the event originated. If you take a
                look at the Sampledata.zip file, it contains four directories (folders): three of the
                folders are named for Apache web servers and one is a MySQL server.
            </p>
            <p>
                The index setting tells Splunk where to put the data. By default, it's stored in
                main, but you might want to consider partitioning your data into different indexes
                if you have many types. For more information about creating custom indexes,
                read "Set up multiple indexes" in the Managing Indexers and Clusters manual.
                For this tutorial, you're just going to change the Host setting.
            </p>
            <ul style="margin-left:25px"><li>Under Host and Set host, choose regex on path.</li></ul>
            <p>
                You want the host value to match the names of the folders contained in
                Sampledata.zip. By selecting regex on path, you're telling Splunk to use a regular
                expression (regex) to match the segment of the path within the compressed file
                and set that as the host value.

                    When it's finished, Splunk displays a message saying the upload was successful.

            <h5>The Summary dashboard</h5>
            <p>
                The Summary dashboard displays information about the data that you just uploaded to this Splunk server and gives you the means to start searching this data.
            </p>
            <div>
                <img src="/static/images/sp12.png" style="width:80%" />
            </div>
            <p>
                The metrics displayed on this dashboard are generated by saved searches that run behind-the-scenes whenever you access and reload this page. (By the end of
                this tutorial, you'll be able to run searches, save them, and use them to build your
                own dashboard, much like this one.)
