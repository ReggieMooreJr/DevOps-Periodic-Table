            <h4>What is Subversion ?</h4>
            <p>
                Subversion is a centralized version control system (VCS) that helps teams manage changes to files and directories over time. UHG-IT offers support for Subversion as a part of the Continuous Integration Services.
            </p>
            <p>
                Subversion can operate across networks, which allows it to be used by people on different computers. At some level, the ability for various people to modify and manage the same set of data from their respective locations fosters collaboration. Progress can occur more quickly without a single conduit through which all modifications must occur. And because the work is versioned, you need not fear that quality is the trade-off for losing that conduit—if some incorrect change is made to the data, just undo that change.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some version control systems are also <i>software configuration management</i> (SCM) systems. These systems are specifically tailored to manage trees of source code and have many features that are specific to software development—such as natively understanding programming languages, or supplying tools for building software. Subversion, however, is not one of these systems. It is a general system that can be used to manage any collection of files. For you, those files might be source code—for others, anything from grocery shopping lists to digital video mixdowns and beyond.
            </p>
            <h4>Subversion's Architecture</h4>
            <p>
                <img src="/static/images/sv1.png" style="width:70%" />
            </p>
            <p>
                On one end is a Subversion repository that holds all of your versioned data. On the other end is your Subversion client program, which manages local reflections of portions of that versioned data. Between these extremes are multiple routes through a Repository Access (RA) layer, some of which go across computer networks and through network servers which then access the repository, others of which bypass the network altogether and access the repository directly.
            </p>
            <h4>Subversion's Components</h4>
            <p>
                Subversion, once installed, has a number of different pieces. The following is a quick overview of what you get. Don't be alarmed if the brief descriptions leave you scratching your head—plenty more pages in this book are devoted to alleviating that confusion.

            <h4>Limitations</h4>
            <p>
                •	Locking
            </p>
            <p style="margin-left:2em;">
                Subversion currently has no support for file locking, to prevent more than one person from working on a particular file at a given point in time. In most cases, locking isn't the desired behavior anyway, so this is not a major missing feature. It can become a problem, though, when dealing with binary files that are not easily merged. Locking can be partially implemented through properties and hooks, but the result is somewhat fragile. According to the Subversion developers, however, locking is on the list of features to be implemented in the next few releases of the system.
            </p>
            <p>
                •	Distributed Repository
            </p>
            <p style="margin-left:2em;">
                Some version control systems (such as the open source Arch system) have support for distributed repositories, which can be extremely important for some larger projects, especially open source projects. Subversion does not currently have any support for distributed repositories, but there is a secondary project, called SVK, that does provide a distributed wrapper for a Subversion repository. There are also some ways to do hot backups of a repository to provide some of the redundancy afforded a distributed system.
            </p>
            <p>
                •	Visualization Tools
            </p>
            <p style="margin-left:2em;">
                In terms of ease of use and comprehensibility, Subversion's copy paradigm is far above the branching and tagging functionality built into CVS. In its current implementation, though, the copy paradigm makes tracking the path a file takes, as it branches and merges over time, difficult at best. In fact, Subversion puts the task of tracking file history trees on the shoulders of the user. In order to maintain information that should be available automatically, the Subversion user must manually track using information entered into the logs at commit time.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-left:2em;">
                For example, look at the complex repository tree in figure below. The <b>svn log</b> command would make it easy for me to see all of the changes that were made to the third revision on the main trunk of the repository, but if I want to see that two of the changes occurred on the main trunk and two occurred on branch 2, it would be impossible, unless I had the foresight to keep careful notes in the log entries about which branch a change occurred on.
